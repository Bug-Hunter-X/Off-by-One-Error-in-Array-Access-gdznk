This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java, specifically accessing an array element beyond its valid index range. The code attempts to iterate through an array, but the loop condition `i <= arr.length` results in an attempt to access an index that does not exist. This results in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` at runtime. The solution demonstrates how to fix the error by using `i < arr.length` which ensures that the loop iterates only up to the last valid index.
